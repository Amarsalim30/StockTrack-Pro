A few minor gaps and best-practice checks to make sure your production toggle is rock-solid:

Provider & Hydration

You’ll need a productionSettingsProvider (or include it in your existing appSettingsProvider) so that downstream widgets or services can watch for changes.

Ensure your settings are hydrated on app startup (e.g. fetched from backend or local cache) before you render any production UI—otherwise you’ll briefly show the feature even if it’s disabled.

Default-Off Fallback

If your JSON payload is missing the "production" toggle or the productionSettings section, default to “off” (and safe defaults in ProductionSettingsModel). This prevents accidentally exposing unfinished manufacturing features.

Reactive Updates

If you support flipping features remotely (e.g. a “feature-flag” dashboard), wire your providers so that updates to the JSON (via pull-to-refresh or ref.invalidate(...)) immediately hide or show production screens without needing an app restart.

Permission Checks

Beyond the toggle, consider combining it with your existing permission system (e.g. only users with PermissionType.manageProduction can even see the “New Production Run” button). That avoids a scenario where the toggle is on but unauthorized users can’t actually do anything.

Error & Edge Handling

When a user tries to reserve or complete a production order but the toggle flips off mid-flow, decide on a UX (e.g. block the action, show a “feature disabled” toast, or queue the operation).

Testing

Write a unit or widget test that pumps your production UI with the toggle on vs off, verifying that UI elements (buttons, menus) appear or disappear as expected.

Telemetry & Logging

If you’re tracking feature adoption, log an event whenever production flows are invoked—but only if the toggle is on. That helps you know how often customers actually use it.

Once you cover those points—provider hydration, sane defaults, reactive updates, permission gating, and tests—you’ll have a robust “production” feature toggle with zero surprises.
